# Data Exploration Project - COVID-19

### Project Overview


This project focuses on exploring and analyzing global COVID-19 data using SQL Server Management Studio. By examining key metrics such as infection rates, death rates, and vaccination progress, the project provides insights into the pandemic's impact across different countries and continents. The analysis utilizes various SQL techniques, including joins, CTEs, temp tables, window functions, and aggregate functions, to uncover patterns and trends in the data.

### Data Sources

The primary datasets used for this project are the "CovidDeaths.xlsx" file and "CovidVaccinations.xlsx" file, containing detailed information about global COVID-19 death counts, infection rates, and vaccination progress across different countries and regions.

### Tools

- Excel - Datasets - CovidDeaths.xlsx [Download Here](https://github.com/ashtamiraj/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/DataExploration/CovidDeaths.xlsx), CovidVaccinations.xlsx [Download Here](https://github.com/ashtamiraj/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/DataExploration/CovidVaccinations.xlsx)
  
- SQL: For querying and analyzing the data.

- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) - For executing SQL queries and managing the database.

### Skills Used

- Joins: To combine data from the COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations tables.

- CTEs: For structuring complex queries and breaking down the analysis into manageable parts.

- Temp Tables: Used to store intermediate results for further analysis.

- Window Functions: To calculate rolling totals, such as cumulative vaccination numbers.

- Aggregate Functions: For summarizing data, such as finding maximum values and calculating percentages.

- Creating Views: To save and reuse complex query results for later visualization or analysis.

- Converting Data Types: Ensuring data consistency by converting fields, such as casting strings to integers.

### Data Analysis

1. Total Cases vs. Total Deaths: Analyzing the likelihood of dying from COVID-19 in different countries.

2. Infection Rate vs. Population: Determining the percentage of a countryâ€™s population that contracted COVID-19.

3. Highest Infection Rate by Country: Identifying countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population.

4. Death Count Analysis: Finding countries and continents with the highest death counts.

5. Global Summaries: Summarizing global COVID-19 cases and deaths, and calculating overall death percentages.

6. Vaccination Progress: Comparing vaccination rates to population sizes and analyzing the progress of vaccination rollouts.
